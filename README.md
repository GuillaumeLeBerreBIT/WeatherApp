# WeatherAppJS

A simple weather dashboard built with **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. This project is designed as a learning tool for understanding how to fetch and display data from APIs, manage dynamic DOM updates, and style responsive layouts.

## 🚀 Features

- **Search for a city** and view current weather and a 3-day forecast.
- **Search history** sidebar with scrollable history cards.
- Responsive, modern UI using Flexbox and CSS Grid.
- Uses [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) for real-time weather data.
- Clean, readable code with modular JavaScript classes.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure for the app.
- **CSS3**: Flexbox, Grid, custom styles, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Fetch API, DOM manipulation, event handling, and classes.
- **Font Awesome & Bootstrap Icons**: For weather and UI icons.
- **Google Fonts (Roboto)**: For modern typography.

## 📝 How It Works

1. **User enters a city** in the search bar and clicks the search button or presses Enter.
2. **JavaScript fetches weather data** from WeatherAPI and displays it as cards.
3. **Search history** is updated with each new city, and is scrollable if it overflows.
4. **Forecast cards** are displayed horizontally and are scrollable if there are many.

## 💡 Customization & Experiments

- Try changing the CSS to experiment with different layouts or color schemes.
- Add more weather details or icons.
- Refactor the JavaScript to use modules or add more features (like removing history items).
